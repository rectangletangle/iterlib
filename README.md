iterlib
======
This library provides composable generator functions which facilitate fancy
iteration patterns with Python.

## Usage:
The library's utility is best shown by example.
```python
import iterlib

print(list(iterlib.paired([0, 1, 2, 3])))
# prints [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)]

print(list(iterlib.chunked([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3)))
# prints [(0, 1, 2), (3, 4, 5)]

print(list(iterlib.windowed([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], size=3, step=2, partial=True)))
# prints [(0, 1, 2), (2, 3, 4), (4, 5)]

print(list(iterlib.windowed(list(range(7)), size=2, step=3, partial=False)))
# prints [(0, 1), (3, 4)]

print(list(iterlib.truncated((i for i in range(6)), 2)))
# prints [0, 1, 2, 3]

nested = [[[0]], [1, [2]], [3]]
print(list(iterlib.flattened(nested)))
# prints [0, 1, 2, 3]
``` 
Although lists are used for input in most of the examples above, the functions
were purposely designed to work with any object that has an `__iter__` method. 
This allows the functions to operate on a wide variety of Python objects, not 
just those that support the slice notation.

## Dependencies:
This library supports both Python versions 2 and 3 with a single mutually
intelligible source.
* Python 2.7 - 3.x

## Installation:
```bash
$ python setup.py install
```
